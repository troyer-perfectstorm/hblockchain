# hblockchain
A weekend project to create a proof of work blockchain. Uses SHA256 for hashing and eliptical curve nistP256 for asymmetric key signing.

Features:
- Single token amount starting from genesis block/user
- Ability to create and add users
- Transaction signing by users
- Pending transaction list that can be signed into a new block with some hashing work.
- Ability to query current wallet amount

Missing:
No network connectivity, no multithreading safety, and a whole lot of other features to make it real.
